        <p>
          You <em>marvel</em> at the gauntlet. A strange feeling courses your
          body as you put it on. You begin to fell strength that was not yest
          felt by any man. You defeat everything and everyone in your path. You
          proceed to go after the dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dragon engulfs everything around it with flames, but your new
          found courage knows no bounds. You stand your ground and attack with
          everything you got. The dragon, now heavily damaged prepares to blow
          one large breath of flames but you lunge your sword straight towards
          its heart using your Gauntlet. You lunge as long as you can jump,
          feeling victory at your Gauntlets fingertips. ALMOST AT THE BEAST's
          CHEST! You see the light of glory
        </p>
        <p>
          You are dead. Perhaps thinking you should've never left your
          aspirations of working in the comfort of a desk as a web developer.
