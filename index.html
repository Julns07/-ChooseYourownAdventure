          You spot a small hut with the door open. You recognize an emblem on
          the side from a previous town you help save. Your yearning for
          adventure tells you to peek inside. You find a woman with a mysterious
          item emitting a strange light. The woman makes no eye contact but says
          that you were being expected.

          "Hello, young warrior. There has been word spread of your courageous
          acts across the land. Why endanger yourself? Is it gold that you do it
          for? or perhaps you seek POWER!" She lays a bag containing gold coins
          offering it as a thank you for what you did for her village days ago.
          She also, however asks an additional favor and says she will aid you
          with a weapon that will make you a greater warrior, that you get to
          keep. " My village is yet again in need, young warrior. There is a
          dragon that haunts us so, will you accept my plea and in return, you
          will be unrivaled in power."
